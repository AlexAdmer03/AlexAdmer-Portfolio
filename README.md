# AlexAdmer-Portfolio

This project involves building a Developer Portfolio and a .NET REST API. The portfolio is deployed on Azure and showcases previous projects through data fetched from the .NET REST API.

## Stack
The portfolio is built using ASP.NET, and it follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The .NET REST API is also built with the same principles.

## Portfolio

The portfolio consists of several sections:

- **Portrait:** An image of the developer
- **CV:** A button for visitors to download the developer's CV
- **Navbar:** A navigational bar for easy access to different sections
- **Social Media/Github Links:** Links to various social media and Github profile
- **About Me:** An introduction of the developer
- **Skills:** A section listing the developer's technical skills
- **Portfolio:** Showcases of the developer's best projects with links to Github and live demos
- **References:** Testimonials or references from previous professional or educational experiences
- **Contact Form:** A form for visitors to get in touch
- **Footer:** A footer with additional information or links

## .NET REST API
This API fetches data about previous projects including their names, tech stacks, dates, descriptions, and other relevant details. The portfolio consumes this API and presents the projects in a "product box" format.

## Testing and Validation
The application is thoroughly tested to prevent unwanted behavior or errors, and it ensures no incorrect data can be entered. In case of incorrect input, relevant warning texts are displayed and the user is given a chance to re-enter.

## Object-Oriented Programming
The application follows the OOP paradigm with a focus on creating well-defined classes with small, focused methods. The codebase adheres to the DRY principle and uses clear, descriptive names for classes, properties, methods, and variables.

## Documentation
This README.md file offers a comprehensive description of the project and API, along with the principles, methods, and patterns used in the creation of this project. The project is hosted on [Azure] and the codebase is available on [Gitpages].

## UX/UI Design
The application aims to provide a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors, ensuring ease of navigation and clarity of information.

## Professionalism
The project reflects a high standard of professionalism in its execution, documentation, and testing, making it a reliable and robust application.
